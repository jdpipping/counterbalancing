<p>
Data acquired for the UK Data Service collection undergo rigorous and comprehensive curation prior to publishing and release.  This ensures that data, documentation and metadata are processed and published to the highest standard possible, both for ease of use in secondary analysis and for archival preservation.
</p>
The curation procedures carried out depend on the individual nature of each dataset and document, but as a general guide the following tasks are always undertaken:
<ul>
<li>Disclosure review - if data confidentiality issues are identified, they are resolved in consultation with the data depositor;</li>
<li>Data are checked for consistency and accuracy for example undocumented/out-of-range codes; </li>
<li>Variable and value label metadata are checked and enhancements undertaken as necessary;</li>
<li>Multiple data and documentation formats may be generated for dissemination and preservation;</li>
<li>A catalogue metadata record is generated and a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is assigned to the study where appropriate.</li>
<li>Where the data are made available for online analysis, in addition to the checks above, question text may be added alongside variables and other enhancements made.</li>
</ul>

For the third edition (November 2024), 14 new variables have been added. These variables correspond to truncated ICD-10 codes, limited to the first letter, derived from free-text responses regarding general health issues, kidney and bladder conditions, and long-standing illnesses. In addition, a small number of variables have been removed as a result of a disclosure review.
